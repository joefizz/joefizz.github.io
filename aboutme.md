pentester by day.  dreamer by night.

There are enough hours in the day, I just have more things I want to do than there is time available.  Also I'm kind of lazy and I like watching TV.

People often say "I'd love to, but i'm too busy".  What they actually mean is "I have other things that take priority".  Stop lying to yourself about having enough time and start looking at what you're prioritising in your life.

What else do you need?

I work in InfoSec primarily as a pentester but quite happy to get my hands dirty with anything.

### my history

I'm trying to keep as little info about myself on this page as possible.  OSINT and all that.  If you can find out who I really am that'd be cool.  I suspect it's not too hard.

I come from NZ but now live in the UK.  Maybe one day i'll be back in NZ, it's a beautiful place.

If you ask me what my favourite movie is I'd default to saying The Lion King.  There's lots of other great movies, and I haven't even seen this one in years, but I'd still put it in my top 15.
